# Whatsapp-Bot-GUI-Windows

My repo for a Whatsapp Bot in Python using Selenium, which works independently and a GUI using Tkinter as User Interface for better User Experience. The config.py file is used to save user information for the browser so you don't have to scan the QR Code everytime, but only once.
